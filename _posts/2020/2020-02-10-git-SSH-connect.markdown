## Introduction

If you are going to use the [git command line tool](../git-commandline-install) it is probably worth setting up a secure shell (or SSH) connection. How to do that for git, primarily using Mac OSX is the topic of this post. It is a summary of GitHub's manual for [Connecting to GitHub with SSH](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).

## Prerequisites

git must be installed, if you need assistance look at the post on [Install git for command line](../git-commandline-install). This tutorial relies heavily on the <span class='app'>Terminal</span> command tool, if you are not acquainted with the command line, the [Command line crash course (pdf)](https://www.computervillage.org/articles/CommandLine.pdf) will teach you most things you need to know.

You also need to have an account at [GitHub.com](https://github.com). Opening an account is free and as long as you agree to make all the code, text and other documents that you publish publicly available, also that is for free. Only if you require very large files or want to keep your documents private you need to pay.

### Check for existing SSH keys

First check for any existing SSH keys. As SSH keys are OS dependent, follow the instructions for your OS at [Checking for existing SSH keys](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys). For Mac OSX, start the <span class='app'>Terminal</span> to list (<span class='terminalapp'>ls</span>) hidden <span class='file'>.ssh</span> files in your home directory:

<span class='terminal'>$ ls -al ~/.ssh</span>

If the returned message shows that you already have (unknown) <span class='file'>.ssh</span> files, please use the GitHub help page on [Checking for existing SSH keys](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys).

### Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent

If you do not have an existing SSH key and wish to generate one, follow the GitHub instructions [Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent). The Mac OSX instructions are summarised here.

In your <span class='app'>Terminal</span> window type:

<span class='terminal'>$ ssh-keygen \-t rsa \-b 4096 \-C "your_email@example.com"</span>

```
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/"youruser"/.ssh/id_rsa):
```
Just hit [return] to accept the default filename (<span class='file'>id_rsa</span>). Then you have to give a passphrase (password), twice.
```
Created directory '/Users/"youruser"/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
```
The SSH keys will be created.
```
Your identification has been saved in /Users/"youruser"/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /Users/"youruser"/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:+AseCretCodeWithDiffereNtAScIICodedSign&nrs your_email@example.com
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 4096]----+
|            o.o  |
|            .= E.|
|             .B.o|
|              .= |
|        S     = .|
|       . o .  .= |
|        . . . oo.|
|             . o+|
|              .o.|
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

Start the ssh-agent in the background:

<span class='terminal'>$ eval \"$(ssh\-agent \-s)\"</span>

The command returns the pid (system tracker for the process).

```
Agent pid 58867
```

To create the SSH configuration file you need a text editor. From the terminal you can for instance use <span class='terminalapp'>pico</span>:

<span class='terminal'>$ pico ~/.ssh/config</span>

Enter (or copy and paste) the following code (it assumes that you saved your key in the default file name <span class='file'>id_rsa</span>):

```
Host *
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Hit [ctrl]+[X] to exit <span class='terminalapp'>pico</span> and save the edits by pressing <span class='terminal'>Y</span> when asked.

Add the SSH key to the system management, you have to give the passphrase you just created:

<span class='terminal'>$ ssh\-add \-K ~/.ssh/id_rsa</span>

```
Enter passphrase for /Users/"youruser"/.ssh/id_rsa:
Identity added: /Users/"youruser"/.ssh/id_rsa (your_email@example.com)
```

In the next section you need the public copy of your key (residing in the file <span class='file'>id_rsa.pub</span>). You are going to tell GitHub.com that this key should open your account for different requests. To copy the key to the clipboard, use the command:

<span class='terminal'>$ pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</span>

### GitHub SSH setup

This section describes how to configure your GitHub account to use the SSH key, it is a shortened version of the GitHub page [Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

![github-menu-select-settings](../../images/github-menu-select-settings.png){: .pull-left}

Go to your GitHub account at [GitHub.com](https://github.com). Click on your avatar (shown to the left), in the drop down menu, select <span class='button'>Settings</span>.

![github-settings-menu-SSH-keys](../../images/github-settings-menu-SSH-keys.png){: .pull-right}

<br />
<br />
<br />

In the user settings window that opens, look at the sidebar for <span class='button'>SSH and GPG keys</span> (as shown to the right), and click it.

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

In the page for SSH-keys and GPG-keys that opens, click the <span class='button'>New SSH key</span> button (below).

<figure>
<img src="../../images/github-SSH-keys-page.png">
<figcaption> Github - SSH keys page.</figcaption>
</figure>

A new page, "SSH keys / Add new", opens (below),
In the <span class='textbox'>Title</span> field, add a descriptive label for the new key. The title should reflect both the machine (owner) and the lock (the GitHub repo). Then paste the content of the clipboard, captured with the <span class='terminalapp'>pbcopy</span> command, in the <span class='textbox'>Key</span> field. When done, click <span class='button'>Add SSH key</span>.

<figure>
<img src="../../images/github-Add-SSH-keys-page.png">
<figcaption> Github - add a New SSH key.</figcaption>
</figure>

![github-add-SSH-key.confirm-pswd](../../images/github-add-SSH-key.confirm-pswd.png){: .pull-right}

If prompted to confirm with your GitHub password, do that.

You should now have the same SSH key defined in your machine and on GitHub. And be ready for seamlessly linking your remote and local _git_ repos.

### Adding additional SSH keys

To add a second SSH key, with a few modifications outlined below you can follow the instructions above, but give a new file name where to save the key. The post [Multiple SSH Keys settings for different github account](https://gist.github.com/jexchan/2351996) is useful for understanding different options.

Open a <span class='app'>terminal</span> window, and generate a SSH key for an email account that you have not yet generated a key for:

<span class='terminal'>$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_other_email@example.com"</span>

Do **NOT** accept the default with the returned message:

```
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/"youruser"/.ssh/id_rsa):
```

as this is probably the name of your already existing key. Instead enter the full path to a new file in the path <span class='file'>/Users/"youruser"/.ssh/</span>, indicating the GitHub account for which this SSH key is intended. Let us say that your second GitHub account is "my_2nd_github_account", then answer like this:

```
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/"youruser"/.ssh/id_rsa): /Users/"youruser"/.ssh/id_rsa_my_2nd_github_account
```

Once the file is saved, you will be prompted for a passphrase, twice:

```
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
```

The SSH key will then be saved in two files, reported at the command line:

```
Your identification has been saved in /Users/"youruser"/.ssh/id_rsa_my_2nd_github_account.
Your public key has been saved in /Users/"youruser"/.ssh/id_rsa_my_2nd_github_account.pub.
```

Followed by details on your SSH key:

```
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:+AseCretCodeWithDiffereNtAScIICodedSign&nrs your_other_email@example.com

The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 4096]----+
|            o.o  |
|            .= E.|
|             .B.o|
|              .= |
|        S     = .|
|       . o .  .= |
|        . . . oo.|
|             . o+|
|              .o.|
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

Start the ssh-agent in the background:

<span class='terminal'>$ eval \"$(ssh\-agent \-s)\"</span>

The command returns the pid (system tracker for the process)

```
Agent pid 16172
```

You now have to open the file <span class='file'>~/.ssh/config</span> and edit it so that it points towards your new SSH key:

<span class='terminal'>pico ~/.ssh/config</span>:

```
Host github.com-my_2nd_github_account
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_my_2nd_github_account
```

Add your new SSH private key to the ssh-agent and store your passphrase in the keychain:

<span class='terminal'>$ ssh\-add \-K ~/.ssh/id_rsa_my_2nd_github_account</span>

```
Identity added: /Users/"youruser"/.ssh/id_rsa_my_2nd_github_account (your_other_email@example.com)
```

With your second SSH key setup on your machine, the registering of the SSH key in your GitHub account ("my_2nd_github_account"), is exactly like before.
